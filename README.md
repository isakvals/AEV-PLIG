# AEV-PLIG

AEV-PLIG is a GNN-based scoring function that predicts the binding affinity of a bound protein-ligand complex given its 3D structure. The paper is published in Nature's *Communications Chemistry* at [Narrowing the gap between machine learning scoring functions and free energy perturbation using augmented data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-025-01428-y).

AEV-PLIG was first published in [How to make machine learning scoring functions competitive with FEP](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6675a38d5101a2ffa8274f62), and received the [people's poster prize at the 7th AI in Chemistry Symposium](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/news/isak-valsson-wins-poster-prize). In the paper we benchmark AEV-PLIG on a wide range of benchmarks, including CASF-2016, our new out-of-distribution benchmark OOD Test, and a test set used for free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, and highlight competitive performance accross the board. Moreover, we demonstrate how leveraging augmented data (generated using template-based modelling or molecular docking) can significantly improve binding affinity prediction correlation and ranking on the FEP benchmark (PCC and Kendall's increases from 0.41 and 0.26, to 0.59 and 0.42), closing the performance gap with FEP calculations while being 400,000 times faster.


In this repo we demonstrate how to use AEV-PLIG for predictions and how to train your own AEV-PLIG model

## Installation guide
AEV-PLIG has been tested on the following systems:
+ macOS: Monterey (12.5.1)
+ Linux: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

### Create conda environment
Installation times may vary, but took around 30 seconds on Mac M1.
For *macOS*:
```
conda env create --file aev-plig-mac.yml
```
For *Linux*:
```
conda env create --file aev-plig-linux.yml
```
Install packages manually:
```
conda create --name aev-plig python=3.8
conda activate aev-plig
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio torch-scatter torch_geometric rdkit torchani qcelemental pandas biopandas scikit-learn

```

## Demo
This section demonstrates how to train your own AEV-PLIG model, and how to use AEV-PLIG to make predictions.

The computational requirements for each script are included, and unless otherwise specified, the hardware used is a Mac M1 CPU.

### Training

#### Download training data
Download the training datasets PDBbind, BindingNet and BindingDB-DCS
```
wget http://pdbbind.org.cn/download/PDBbind_v2020_other_PL.tar.gz
wget http://pdbbind.org.cn/download/PDBbind_v2020_refined.tar.gz
wget http://bindingnet.huanglab.org.cn/api/api/download/binding_database
wget https://www.bindingdb.org/bind/chemsearch/marvin/SDFdownload.jsp?download_file=/rwd/data/surflex/surflex.tar
```
Put PDBbind data into *data/pdbbind/refined-set* and *data/pdbbind/general-set*

Put BindingNet data into *data/bindingnet/from_chembl_client*

Put BindingDB-DCS data into *data/bindingdb/surflex*

#### Generate pickled graphs
The following scripts will generate graphs into *pdbbind.pickle*, *bindingnet.pickle*, and *bindingdb.pickle*. Takes around 40 minutes to run.
```
python generate_pdbbind_graphs.py
python generate_bindingnet_graphs.py
python generate_bindingdb_graphs.py
```

#### Generate data for pytorch
Running this script takes around 2 minutes.
```
python create_pytorch_data.py
```
The script outputs the following files in *data/processed/*:

*pdbbind_U_bindingnet_U_bindingdb_ligsim90_fep_benchmark_train.pt*, *pdbbind_U_bindingnet_U_bindingdb_ligsim90_fep_benchmark_valid.pt*, and *pdbbind_U_bindingnet_U_bindingdb_ligsim90_fep_benchmark_test.pt*

#### Run training
Running the following script takes 28 hours using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
GPU. Once a model has been trained, the next section describes how to use it for predictions.
```
python training.py --activation_function=leaky_relu --batch_size=128 --dataset=pdbbind_U_bindingnet_U_bindingdb_ligsim90 --epochs=200 --head=3 --hidden_dim=256 --lr=0.00012291937615434127 --model=GATv2Net
```
The trained models are saved in *output/trained_models*


### Predictions
In order to make predictions, the model requires a *.csv* file with the following columns:
- *unique_id*, unique identifier for the datapoint
- *sdf_file*, relative path to the ligand *.sdf* file
- *pdb_file*, relative path to the protein *.pdb* file

An example dataset is included in *data/example_dataset.csv* for this demo.

```
python process_and_predict.py --dataset_csv=data/example_dataset.csv --data_name=example --trained_model_name=model_GATv2Net_ligsim90_fep_benchmark
```
The script processes data in *dataset_csv*, and removes datapoints if:
1. .sdf file cannot be read by RDkit
2. Molecule contains rare element
3. Molecule has undefined bond type

The script then creates graphs and pytorch data to run the AEV-PLIG model specified with *trained_model_name*.

The predictions are saved under *output/predictions/data_name_predictions.csv*

For the example dataset, the script takes around 20 seconds to run

### Docking Rescoring with AEV-PLIG
The `rescore_docking.py` script allows you to conveniently **rescore docked ligands** using **AEV-PLIG**.  
This script processes all ligands in a given directory and outputs a **CSV file with rescoring results**.

#### Usage Example
```python
python rescore_docking.py -p protein.pdb -l docked_ligands/ --num_workers 8
```

#### Input Requirements
- **Protein file** (`.pdb` (recommended), but `mol2` and `pdbqt` should also work).
- **Docked ligand files** (preferably **SDF format** for highest accuracy).
- **Mol2 (TRIPOS format) is also supported** via RDKit.
- Other formats (**PDB, PDBQT, ...**) can be converted using automatically **OpenBabel**, but this may introduce minor inaccuracies.

#### Best Practices for Accuracy
- **Use SDF format** whenever possible to retain structural details.
- **Ensure explicit hydrogens are present** (they should be included from docking).
- If using automatic format conversion, manually verify ligand integrity to minimize errors.

#### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `-p, --protein`        | Path to the input **protein file** (PDB or other formats convertible to PDB). |
| `-l, --ligands`        | Path to the directory containing **ligand files** (e.g., SDF, MOL, MOL2). |
| `--trained_model_name` | Name of the trained model used for rescoring. |
| `--data_name`          | Identifier for the dataset (used for output file naming). |
| `--output_dir`         | Directory where output files (graphs and predictions) will be saved. |
| `-c, --num_workers`    | Number of parallel processes (**default: all available cores**). |
| `--device`             | Computation device (`'auto'`, `'cpu'`, or a specific CUDA device index). |
| `--debug`              | Provide more logging/debug information while running the calculations. |
